## INSTALLATION

Again, this git repository only contains documentation and examples
for the emoltemplate.sh molecule-builder software.

To install emoltemplate, you must install moltemplate.
To obtain the latest version of moltemplate, visit:

https://github.com/jewettaij/moltemplate

and follow the installation instructions.  (Again, please disregard the "doc" and "examples" subdirectories located in the "moltemplate" repository.  These files are specific to the LAMMPS version of moltemplate, not ESPResSo.)

Alternatively, if that does not work, you can download a recent .tar.gz file from:
