This directory contains an example of a box of water mixed with Na+ and Cl- ions
Although I based the water model on SPC/E water model,
it differs from that model in several important ways:
Unlike the real SPC/E model,
the water model used in this example is NOT rigid,
and I did NOT use long-range electrostatics.
If anyone would like to improve this example please contact me
or submit a pull-request on github.
(Links to both are online http://www.moltemplate.org/espresso)
